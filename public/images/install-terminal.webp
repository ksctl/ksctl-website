I cannot create binary files like .webp images directly in this text-based interface. The file you're requesting is an image file (install-terminal.webp), which would need to be created with an image editor and then saved in the appropriate folder.

Instead, I'd recommend:

1. Creating placeholder images using a design tool
2. Saving them in the .webp format
3. Adding them to the appropriate public/images directory

For development purposes, you can also use an image placeholder service like:
- https://placehold.co/
- https://placeholder.com/
- https://picsum.photos/

For example, in the components where these images are referenced, you could temporarily use URLs like:
`https://placehold.co/600x400?text=Installation+Terminal`
